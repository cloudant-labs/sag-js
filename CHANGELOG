Sag-JS Changes
==============

Version 0.2.0
-------------

New Features

  * All of the thrown exceptions are now Error's instead of strings. Closes #1.

  * Introduction of `on('event', callback)` which allows you to create global
    event handlers. Currently the only event supported is 'error' whose
    callback gets the response object as its parameter. For example, you can
    make a global error handler by specifying
    `sag.on('error', function(resp) { ... });`. Closes #5.

Version 0.1.0
-------------

First release, complying with Sag v0.7.1's API.
